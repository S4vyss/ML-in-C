# ML-in-C

Started doing with this youtube video [tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1TbWe8bVOc&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw&index=9)
The project will be expanded. Ideally I want to create a whole machine learning framework akin to tensorflow or sklearn (of course on smaller scale)

TODO: 
- Fix the problem with gradients. (They stay at 0 during training)
